# CS-Portfolio
Welcome to my CS Portfolio, a collection of projects that merge data analysis, machine learning, website development, and marketing strategies to uncover solutions, strengths, and areas for improvement in businesses and research. This repository serves as both a showcase of my technical abilities and a playground for advancing my skills in modeling, optimization, and practical AI applications.

üìå What's Inside?
Sport Dojo Predictive Model: 
This project leverages machine learning and statistical analysis to predict athlete engagement in the Sport Dojo program. By analyzing data from over 300 participants, I developed logistic and linear regression models to identify key factors such as age, education, engagement frequency, and teamwork preferences. The model demonstrated strong performance, utilizing feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and performance metrics like precision and recall.

Key findings reveal how traits like interdependence and leadership can pinpoint potential coaches and sports mentors, allowing for optimized recruitment, resource allocation, and marketing strategies. Future enhancements include integrating real-time data and expanding model applications to fields like health and education analytics.This project highlights my ability to apply AI and machine learning to solve real-world problems, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions that lead to impactful outcomes. I also effectively communicate insights through data storytelling, translating complex findings into actionable business strategies.

Electrical Systems Engineering Case Study ‚Äì Modeling & Optimization of COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics
This project utilizes linear dynamical systems to model and analyze the transmission of COVID-19 in the St. Louis metropolitan area. I developed and optimized a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) model, providing a data-driven framework to assess the impact of targeted policy interventions on the pandemic.

Key Contributions & Methodology: 
- Custom SIRD Model Development ‚Äì Built a flexible COVID-19 transmission model from scratch, ensuring transparency and customization without relying on built-in 
  MATLAB functions.
- Data-Driven Optimization ‚Äì Used numerical optimization (fmincon) to calibrate infection, recovery, and fatality rates against real-world data, minimizing the 
  error between predicted and actual case counts.
- Wave-Specific Analysis ‚Äì Segmented pandemic data into phases, capturing transmission rate variations more effectively than single-rate models.
- Policy Impact Simulation ‚Äì Modeled hypothetical interventions (e.g., masking, isolation, vaccination) and demonstrated a potential 25% reduction in cases and 
  fatalities.
- Extended SIRDVN Model ‚Äì Enhanced the model to include vaccination rates and breakthrough infections, providing a comprehensive framework for future epidemic 
  management.

Results & Insights: 
- The optimized model closely matched real-world data, demonstrating predictive accuracy.
- Wave-specific analysis provided more nuanced insights into transmission patterns.
- Policy interventions such as enhanced masking, isolation, and vaccination would have significantly mitigated disease spread.
- The extended model highlighted the crucial role of vaccination in altering transmission dynamics, offering valuable insights for future epidemic responses.

Conclusion & Impact: This work underscores the potential of mathematical modeling in shaping public health strategies. By integrating data-driven optimization with dynamic modeling, we created a robust foundation for data-informed decision-making in public health. The methods developed here are applicable not only to COVID-19 but also to future infectious disease outbreaks.

This project demonstrates my expertise in mathematical modeling, optimization, and data science, making me well-equipped for roles in systems analysis, healthcare analytics, and policy research
