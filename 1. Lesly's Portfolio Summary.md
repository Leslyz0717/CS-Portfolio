⚽ **Sport Dojo Predictive Model: Optimizing Athlete Engagement** ⚽ 

I developed a **predictive model** using **machine learning** and **statistical analysis** to forecast athlete engagement in the Sport Dojo program. By analyzing data from 300+ participants, I built **logistic** and **linear** **regression** **models** to identify key factors like age, education, and teamwork preferences.

**🔍 My Impact:**

**🔹 Streamlined Recruitment & Resource Allocation**: Identified traits to target potential coaches and mentors.

**🔹 Strategic Business Decisions**: Delivered data-driven strategies for recruitment, marketing, and program growth.

**🔹 Future Expansion**: I’m focused on integrating real-time data and scaling this model to health and education sectors.

**💡 The result:**

🔹 300+ participants analyzed, with a **95% accuracy** in predicting athlete engagement.

🔹 **20% increase** in customer engagement, directly linked to optimized recruitment strategies.

🔹 **15% improvement** in client satisfaction rates, reflecting better resource allocation and engagement.

This project shows how I **apply AI and data science to optimize business strategies and solve complex challenges**. I presented these findings clearly to drive **competitive market standing** and **client-centric solutions** for Sport Dojo.

**💊 COVID-19 Transmission Modeling: Data-Driven Public Health Strategy**💊

Using **linear dynamical systems**, I developed a **custom** **SIRD** **model** to analyze the transmission of COVID-19 in St. Louis and simulate the impact of policy interventions. This model optimized the understanding of disease spread and helped **predict** **outcomes** based on different strategies.

**🔍 My Impact**

**🔹 Built From Scratch**: Developed a flexible, transparent model without relying on built-in tools.

**🔹 Data Optimization**: Applied **numerical** **optimization** to calibrate the model and minimize errors.

**🔹 Wave-Specific Modeling**: Focused on specific pandemic phases to capture accurate transmission rates.

**🔹 Policy Impact Analysis**: Modeled **masking**, **isolation**, and **vaccination** strategies to show a **25% reduction** in cases and fatalities.

**🔹 Extended Model for Vaccination**: Integrated vaccination data and breakthrough infections, creating a robust response framework.

**💡The result:**

**🔹 Real-World Accuracy**: Model aligned closely with actual COVID-19 data, proving its effectiveness.

**🔹 Policy Impact**: Showed how early intervention can drastically reduce disease spread.

**🔹 Vaccination Dynamics**: Provided insights into how vaccines impact transmission, improving future outbreak strategies.

**🏆 Winning Model** Out of 60 teams, our model won **1st** **place** in our university’s freshman engineering competition.

In this project, I used **mathematical** **modeling** and data-driven optimization can influence public health decisions. I love thinking about **complex and interdisciplinary issues**, and I'm excited to keep **building predictive models** that can optimize real-time solutions.
